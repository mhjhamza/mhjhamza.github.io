                    The courses helps you learn the core concepts of OpenCV faster by taking a recipe-based approach where you can try out different code snippets to understand a concept. Every operation is performed step-by-step and the code is neatly documented so it’s easier for the audience to reuse the modules in their own projects.

                            A US-based surveillance company wanted to monitor UAV and keep tracking its activities until it exits the field of view using deep learning techniques. It was a Deep Learning CNN based Object Detection System to be deployed in fields capable of observing the aerial view, identifying an elevated object that enters the field and tracking it until it exits the field of view. This included calibrating custom-made hardware with system, training object detection model for QuadCopter and writing an intelligent script to track the objects in 360 degrees.
